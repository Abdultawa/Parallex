    I do NOT in any way condone the spreading of this program, in other words I do NOT spread the releases to any websites, P2P networks or any other public available location. I urge that this releases should not be spread like that at all.

    "I DO NOT in any way condone the selling or redistribution of these program, this was NEVER my intention."
    
    R@1n does NOT take any responsibility of computer-loss or any data-errors that may occur from using these program. Keep in mind that you are using a third party solution to something we did not develop in the first place.

It remains to be seen how affected you are of the End User License Agreements (EULAs). They can't supersede domestic laws, remember that.

Though R@1n's base of operation does not reside in the Unites States, and thus I am NOT bound to the US legislations like:
